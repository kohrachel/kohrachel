## hi. i'm rachel.

I code, [write](https://kohrachel.com/), and drink way too many matcha lattes. 

I'm studying Computer Science and Physics at Vanderbilt University in a futile attempt to understand the quantum behavior of my code. All I've learned is that you really shouldn't give a physicist a cat, Emacs is annoying but will make people think you're a lot smarter than you are, and that React is really joyful. 

I've built a few hackathon-esque projects and my website, [kohrachel.com](https://kohrachel.com). 

I'm also obsessed with matcha and half-sweet less-ice bubble milk tea from Chichasanchen.
