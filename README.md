## hi. i'm rachel.

I code, [write](https://kohrachel.com/), and [solve nerdy challenges](https://squ1rrel.dev/author/kohrachel).

Currently, I'm studying Computer Science and Physics at Vanderbilt University. 

I'm also obsessed with matcha and half-sweet less-ice bubble milk tea. 

## Wanna be friends?
