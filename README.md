## hi. i'm rachel.

I code, [write](https://kohrachel.com/), and drink way too many matcha lattes. 

I'm studying Computer Science and Physics at Vanderbilt University in a futile attempt to understand the quantum behavior of my code. All I've learned is that you really shouldn't give a physicist a cat, Emacs is annoying but will make people think you're a lot smarter than you are, and that React is really joyful. 

I've built a few hackathon-esque projects and my website, [kohrachel.com](https://kohrachel.com). 

I'm also obsessed with matcha and half-sweet less-ice bubble milk tea from Chichasanchen.

If that happens (and a refresh doesn't solve the issue), you can right click to copy the link or copy it from the address bar and reopen it in a new tab. I'm pretty sure it's a thing to stop bots but unfortunately it's also stopping me. And no I'm not a bot despite what some of my failed CAPTCHAs might believe.
